# Linear Regression

##Overview
This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/vOppzHpvTiQ) video by Siraj Raval on Youtube. The goal is to predict an animal's body weight given it's brain weight. The model we'll be using is called [Linear Regression](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-linear-regression/). The dataset we're using to train our model is a list of brain weight and body weight measurements from a bunch of animals. We'll fit our line to the data using the scikit learn machine learning library, then plot our graph using matplotlib.

##Dependencies

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

You can just run
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
in terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Here is a link to [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) if you don't already have it.

##Usage

Type `python regression.py` into terminal and you'll see the scatter plot and line of best fit appear.
